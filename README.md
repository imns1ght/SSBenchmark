# Search Algorithms Analysis

The project is focused in compare the search algorithms [Linear search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search), [Binary search (iterative and recursive)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), [Ternary search (iterative and recursive)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search), [Jump search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_search) and [Fibonacci search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_search_technique) utilizing the empirical analysis technique to determine as input size affects the performance of search algorithms.

## TODO

- [ ] Review this old code
- [ ] Add sorting functions (and write a new version)

## Requirements
* C++
* GCC/G++
* [chrono](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/)
* [iterator](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/)
* [cmath](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/)
* [iomanip](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iomanip/)
* [fstream](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/)
* [sstream](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/)
* [string](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/?kw=string)
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Compiling
You can use the Makefile. In the root directory of the project, enter:

```bash
make
```

## Usage
After compiling, enter:

```bash
./searching
```

Now, you'll need to enter the range of the array that you want to perform searches
```cpp
>>> Begin: 0
>>> End: 1000000
```

Put the value to search
```cpp
>>> Value to search: 1337
```

After that, we need to define the number of samples.

Assuming we want 50 samples of data, with begin = 0 and end = 1000000. We will have samples with interval of (1000000 âˆ’ 0)/50 = 20000. So, the size of the samples will be like that 20000, 40000, 60000, ... , 980000, 1000000.

```cpp
>>> Number of samples: 50
```

Finally, we will enter the search function we want to use!

```cpp
>>> Available functions <<<
[1] Linear search
[2] Binary search
[3] Binary search recursive
[4] Ternary search
[5] Ternary search recursive
[6] Jump search
[7] Fibonacci search

>>> Function you want to use: 2
```
